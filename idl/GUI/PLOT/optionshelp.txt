;   Where to position model structure
;
;       keyword PHIO (double - DEGREES) allows a rotation of 
;	 	model structure in phi, useful for fitting data.
;		or for Carrington maps for changing numbers on X axis
;
;		By FORWARD convention, model structures 
;		are centered on phi=0
;
;   		If you are comparing model and data, or looking from
;		a viewing angle for a given day, and want to (for 
;		example) move a structure to a limb longitude appropriate
;		to the central meridian of the day, the way to do it
;		is to change PHIO rather than CMER.  This way also,
;		if you go back and forth between STEREO and Earth's view
;		point, the central meridian will change and then you 
;		can see how this affects the model centered at what
;		used to be the limb for the other viewpoint.
;
;		For model CAVMORPH, parameter PHCS is similar to
;		to PHIO (unlike THCS vs THETAO, see below).
;		Except that embedded cavity and nougat central longitude
;		(NOUGPHCS and CAVPHCS) do not automatically change with PHCS,
;		while PHIO rotates entire structure, streamer, cavity, and nougat
;		
;
;	keyword THETAO (double - DEGREES) similar to PHIO, allows
;		a rotation of model structure from equator to 
;		a latitude THETAO in heliographic coordinates.
;	
;		By FORWARD convention, model structures are centered on 
;		theta=90 in heliographic coordinates.
;
;		So, by choosing coordinates (THETAO, PHIO) a model
;		structure is placed anywhere on the sun, and then
;		an integral can be performed
;		depending on the viewer's position (BANG, CMER)
;		
;		CAVMORPH model parameter THCS is subtly different 
;		from THETAO, in that it simply moves the model
;		streamer center to colatitude central position THCS.
;		Changing THETAO rotates everyhing, so a streamer would
;		lie along a great circle,not parallel to the equator as
;		it would from a change in THCS. Also, note NOUGTHCS/NOUGTOP_TH and
;		CAVTOP_TH (positions of embedded cavity top and nougat center and top) do not
;		automatically change with a change in THCS, whereas a change
;		in THETAO rotates the entire structure, streamer, cavity, and nougat.
;
; 		NOTE THETAO is not really meaningful for global models
;		***so turned off for PSIMAS and AWSOM and PFSSMOD and TOMO and STRIA***
;
;		(note PHIO can still be useful for global models
;		for making Carrington maps not centered on 180)
;
;		NOTE also- THETAO is NOT equivalent to P angle/roll
;		  except for the special case of BANG=0, CMER=-90, PHIO=0

;               DN/S/DETPIX is relative to detector pixel size, so,

;               Every instrument will have a different detector pixel

;		(can also use 41 - which is red/blue negative/positive)
;		Also 7777 for AIA colortables

;               Default = '' will be central color of color bar

;		Default red
;

;		plane of sky field to plot vector for
;
; 	keyword NARROW (integer)
;		spacing of vectors 
; 		note number of points to skip varies with grid size,
