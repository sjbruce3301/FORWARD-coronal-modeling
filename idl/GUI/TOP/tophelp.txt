OBSERVABLES TAB
;  lots of observables that may be plotted integrated along the line of sight
;   magnetically sensitive observables (like Stokes polarimetry)
;   will not show as a choice if model not magnetic (e.g., model CAVMORPH)
;
; Some of the less obvious ones:
;   WL Coronagraphs -- 
;	XPOLG -- position from X=0 plane of center of mass along lines of sight
;		(units, solar radii)
;	TPOLG -- angle position from tau=0 (Thomson Sphere) of center of mass along lines of sight
;		(units, radians)
;	XPOLF/XPOLB -- position from X=0 of localized source determined from polarization ratio
;		two solutions-- one will be a "ghost" solution symmetric about Thomson Sphere
;		from true solution
;		(units, solar radii)
;	TPOLU -- position from Thomson Sphere of localiazed source determined from polarization ratio
;		unsigned, so only one solution
;		(units, radians)
;	PR = polariation ratio, (1-p)/(1+p) (also = sin^2(tpolu))
;	WLRAT = spectrographic WL -- like CODEX -- gets back
;	  ratio at two chosen wavelengths RAT1 and RAT2
;	  also spectrum saved in WLSPecStruct
;

PHYSICAL DIAGNOSTICS
; lots of physical plasma properties that may
; be plotted in the plane of the sky
;  some are dependent on model (e.g., if magnetic or not)


SETTINGS TAB
;
;       keyword    BG_INPUT,BG_OUTPUT -- a way of providing
;                 background images to subtract off
;                 in particular, if bg_output is set to a named file
;                 integrated pB,B will be saved in it
;                 conversely -- if bg_input file is selected 
;		  it will be subtracted off
;                 from pB, B before calculating P=pB/B
;
;       keyword MEMORY (integer) -- set to greater than zero if want to 
;	loop one of the grid dimensions, to save IDL memory, if set to 
;	other than one then nmem=memory pixel arrays will be looped through 
;	a total of (ngrid*ngy)/nmem times (bites). memory = 1 goes to 
;       Default value, 10000.
;       Some machines may be able to run with memory=0, so no loops,
;	(without IDL crashing) and this should improve run time.
;
;	Note Memory affects the plane-of-sky (X-Y) dimensions -- you might also find yourself
;	out of memory if you make NLOS too big.  To deal with this, decrease the value of 
;	MEMORY in step with any increase in NLOS - since the total number of grid pioints
;	is MEMORY X NLOS
;
;	NOTE MEMORY = -1 will force nmem=1, so there will be a loop of 
;	ngrid steps.
;		
;
;      keyword READPRAMS(string), if set uses saved set of (input) parameters
;		Default '' means unset
;
;      keyword READMAP(string), if set can rerun a forward calculation 
;	either identically or with some changes to the way data is 
;	displayed (through changes to plotting keywords). 
;	readmap="(mapname).sav"
;       If CoMP or physical diagnostic, can also change quantity being plotted
;	without requiring recalculation.
;		***SAVE FILE VIA FOR_DRIVE,/SAVEMAP,MAPNAME='myfile' ***
;		***RESTORE FILE VIA FOR_DRIVE,READMAP='myfile.sav'
;               ***NOTE MAPNAME AND SAVEMAP ARE DOCUMENTED BELOW***
;
;		Default '' means unset


;       keyword WORKING_DIR (string) -- if set, 
;		all I/O occurs here.
;		fortran executable can also saved into working_dir.
;		CAN BE SET AS ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE $FORWARD_WORKING_DIR
;		DEFAULT '' means unset - defaults to directly idl session runs from
;

CALENDAR TAB
;
;       keyword DATE (string) - date of observations
;               may affect calibration time (various programs in OBSERVABLES)
;		also used to identify viewer position
;		and to choose PFSS or PSIMAS or AWSOM datacube
;               Default empty string means unset
;


FORWARD button
; clicking on this runs the forward calculation
; or displays the data


GATHER WINDOWS
; gathers widget windows


OUTPUT TAB
;
;      keyword SAVEPRAMS (string), if set, saves (input) parameters to file
;		default '' unset
;
;
;      keyword MAPNAME (string) defaults to name of model+observable+output.
;               default set here as then this is overwritten
;               once these elements are established within FOR_DRIVE.
;               ***note -- mapname is used for any output, whether it is
;               a IDL save file, plot, or fits. 
;
;      keyword SAVEMAP (1 or 0), if set, saves all the output structures
;               to a save file called  MAPNAME.sav. 
;
;		***SAVE FILE VIA FOR_DRIVE,/SAVEMAP,MAPNAME='myfile' ***
;		***RESTORE FILE VIA FOR_DRIVE,READMAP='myfile.sav'
;               ***NOTE READMAP IS DOCUMENTED ABOVE***
;
;       keyword EXTRATITLE (string) -- extra information for title
;               used in figures and also added to output mapname
;               (e.g., name of parameter being varied)
;               Default '' means unset
;
;  *********************
;	OUTPUT INCLUDES:  
;		
;	   QUANTMAP: this is the quantity calculated, e.g., the particular 
;		observable or physical diagnostic. It includes the DATA, and other
;		map parameters that define its center, pixelsize, etc.
;		It can be plotted or manipulated as a SolarSoft map structure.
;
;	   STOKESSTRUCT: If the quantity calculated is a Coronal Polarimetric quantity,
;		I,Q, U, V are all saved here.  If parameter IWLINE is set (default)
;		the full wave profile is saved, along with velocities etc.
;		If the map is read in for one of these other quantities rather than the original
;		in QUANTMAP, FORWARD will replace the DATA in QUANTMAP with the new requested observable.
;
;	   LOSPRAMSSTRUCT: Includes parameters defining viewers line of sight used in calculation 
;	   GRIDPRAMSSTRUCT: Includes parameters defining grid in plane of sky
;	   OBSPRAMSSTRUCT: Includes parameters defining observable calculated
;	   MODPRAMSSTRUCT: Includes parameters defining model used
;
;	   MODSOLSTRUCT: Model values for physical parameters in the plane of sky 
;
;	   PLOTSAVE: Plotting choices for map - can be overwritten
;	   
; 	   LOSINPUTS, GRIDINPUTS, OBSINPUTS, MODELINPUTS: mostly redundent with the *PRAMSSTRUCT -
;		but in a form that enables quick loading of the widget fields
;
;
;  *********************
;
;      keyword  MOREPLOTS (1 or 0) - useful when multiple plots are being
;		 made using NOERASE
;               basically keeps postscript file device open while set.
;		and in widget to allow multiple plot windows open
;
;       keyword NOERASE (0/1) - don't erase - basically overplot on existing plot
;
;	keyword TIFF, PSPLOT (1/0)
;		plot tiff and/or postscript file
;	Defaults 0
; 	(note FOR_DRIVE has more plotting options but they are not yet robust
;		on the widgets)
;


PRINT COMMAND button
; this will generate text call to FOR_DRIVE - if copied and pasted 
; into solarsoft IDL session, will recreate forward calculation currently
; set up.  Will also save text file with this info called gui_command_log.txt

RESET button
; will reset to defaults except for last model used

QUIT button
; quits widget session

RECALCULATE button
; runs FORWARD and forces full recalculation
; otherwise if run using FORWARD button will look for
; last saved map and see if anything has been changed that would affect
; LOS calculation.  This saves time when for example doing simple plotting
; display type changes, but, for example if one zooms in one might want to
; force full recalculation of LOS to get higher resolution

; SAVE button
; runs FORWARD (not necessarily full recalculation)
; and saves to file named with MAPNAME *and* the current Julian time stamp
;
;  See above under SAVEMAP for description of contents of saved file
