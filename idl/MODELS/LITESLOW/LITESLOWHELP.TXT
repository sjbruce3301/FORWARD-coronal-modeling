; Name: LITESLOW
;
; REFERENCE: Lites, B. and Low, B. C., Sol. Phys., 174, 91, 1997
;
; Purpose: Calculate the density, temperature, magnetic field of the
;          LITES-Low model at a location rpB, thetapB, phipB (true spherical
;          coordinates)
;
;
; Lites & Low 1996 model of spheromak magnetic field.
;  
; This model is force-free both in the spheromak and surrounding open field regions.  
; This solution will be in equilibrium except at the interface between spheromak and 
; open field solution. An isothermal, hydrostatic background is assumed.
;

;;Keyword Inputs:  
;		   
;         MORPHOLOGY/POSITION
;
;		FRONTHEIGHT, LEGSANG-- these are the position of the front
;			of the bubble and the angle subtended by its legs
;			at the bubble's broadest point, 
;			legsang INPUT in DEGREES
;			these inputs will determine 
;			OUTPUTS xo and rbub (see below)	
;			DEFAULT FRONTHEIGHT=1.3, LEGSANG=15.
;
;         PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
;
;
;		AO - this is the constant of proportionality between
;	   		the stream function S and the pressure Pi
;			DEFAULT AO=1.75  OUTPUT multiplied by -1/Muse
;			where Muse = (2./3.)*ao*alnot*alnot
;			This is because the roots alnot chosen in 
;			liteslow vs giblow end up with B vs. -B 
;			-- same handedness, but opposite sign.
;			Muse allows us to input ao with a value that ends up
;			equivalent to the maximum Br (bubble coords)
;			
;
;	     	ALNOTRBUB - the eigenvalue parameter of the twisted flux
;	    		rope model -- OUTPUT alnot (rbub calculated below)
;			DEFAULT (unlikely to change) ALNOTRBUB=4.4935
;			NOTE THIS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM WIDGET 
;
; 		SIG1 - the rotation about the spheromak core (rotation
;           		about x-axis)  INPUT in DEGREES
;			DEFAULT SIG1=90  OUTPUT in RADIANS
;
;		OUT -  a parameter which scales the outer field solution
;			since there is a discontinuity around bubble for field
;			(and total pressure) this can be used to scale external
;			field as desired  DEFAULT out= 0.1 OUTPUT unchanged
;
;		DENSSCALE - a parameter that scales the outer density
;			similar concept to OUT
;                       DEFAULT 2.
;
;    		AA,BB,CC,DD,EE,FF - background density, pressure parameters, 
;			for hydrostatic equilibrium OUTPUT as above but
;			aa, cc, ee  multiplied by 1d8 
;			use values from Schmit&Gibson 2011
;
;
;  		VELIMPOSE - impose a velocity of magnitude VELIMPOSE 
;		directed along the field
;               will overwrite any velocity field already loaded into the cube
;               if nonzero
;                       DEFAULT 0.d0
